type 'a t
(** Dictionary type (ie an '\{ \}' JS object). However it is restricted 
    to hold a single type; therefore values must have the same type. 
    
    This Dictionary type is mostly use with the [Js_json.t] type. *)

type key = string
(** Key type *)

external get : 
  'a t -> 
  key -> 
  'a option = "" [@@bs.get_index] [@@bs.return {undefined_to_opt}]
(** [get dict key] returns [None] if the [key] is not found in the 
    dictionary, [Some value] otherwise *)

external unsafeGet : 'a t -> key -> 'a = "" [@@bs.get_index] 
(** [unsafeGet dict key] return the value if the [key] exists, 
    otherwise an {b undefined} value is returned. Must be used only 
    when the existence of a key is certain. (i.e. when having called [keys]
    function previously. 

@example {[
Array.iter (fun key -> Js.log (Js_dict.unsafeGet dic key)) (Js_dict.keys dict) 
]} 
*)

external set : 'a t -> key -> 'a -> unit = "" [@@bs.set_index]  
(** [set dict key value] sets the [key]/[value] in [dict] *)

external keys : 'a t -> string array = "Object.keys" [@@bs.val]
(** [keys dict] returns all the keys in the dictionary [dict]*)

external empty : unit -> 'a t = "" [@@bs.obj]
(** [empty ()] returns en empty dictionary *)

(** Experimental internal funciton *)
val unsafeDeleteKey : string t -> string -> unit [@bs]
