(** This module corresponds to Lwt_unix but in an O'Browser environment. *)

(** {6 Sleeping} *)

val sleep : float -> unit Lwt.t
  (** [sleep d] is a threads which remain suspended for [d] seconds
      and then terminates. *)

val yield : unit -> unit Lwt.t
  (** [yield ()] is a threads which suspends itself and then resumes
      as soon as possible and terminates.
      Unlike [Lwt_preemtive.yield],
      that version will also let the browser work if it has something to
      do (for example redraw the page).
